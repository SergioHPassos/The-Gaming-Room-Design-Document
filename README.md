# The-Gaming-Room-Design-Document
In this journal, you will make a submission to your portfolio. Remember that you will submit portfolio artifacts in different courses throughout the Computer Science program. This portfolio is an opportunity for you to catalog your learning and showcase your best work to future employers. You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting will help add context to refresh your memory when you review your portfolio in the future.

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The clients "The Gaming Room" were currently developing a game called "Draw It or Lose It" for andriod. The clients wanted to expand its audience by transitioning into a cloud platform.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Time management and my developed code on the project were two key important factors. I focused on layingout my time and using it wisely. Lastly, the way I designed and executed my code was very clear and concise.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
For such a small project I would say no. Flowcharts, and pseduocode would have been a better aid in developing their software. However, I did find the information on the three operating systems useful for knowledge on future projects. Knowing limitations and working around them is key for developing software.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the design document. I have the least amount of experience, so I knew right away my inexpereince would negatively effect it. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user experience is everything in developnig software in the provate sector. If users aren't happy when using your software than why would they want to use it. The user experience was at the forfront in development. The team wanted to make it as painless as possible for the user to experience their game.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I kept functions as small, clear and concise as I could. Additionally, I also added javadoc comments to keep everything as professional, and increase the readability of the programming.
