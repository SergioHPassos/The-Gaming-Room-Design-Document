# The-Gaming-Room-Design-Document
In this journal, you will make a submission to your portfolio. Remember that you will submit portfolio artifacts in different courses throughout the Computer Science program. This portfolio is an opportunity for you to catalog your learning and showcase your best work to future employers. You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting will help add context to refresh your memory when you review your portfolio in the future.
